    <h2>Thank you for Validating this idea</h2>
    <p>The product is not ready yet. <br>
        I made this landing page to make sure I'm making something people want.<br>
        I haven't saved any data besides your email, so I can let you know when the product is ready.<br>
        Thanks again for showing interest and speak to you soon!
